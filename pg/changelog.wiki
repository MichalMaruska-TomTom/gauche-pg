* I try to remove   *pg:query-extract-keyed-tuples*

** moved to  pg.recordset ?
  and provided through  *get-linked-rs*

*** How was it used?
we have a result and want to skip to another. We have to locate data on the row,
and select a direction (of the skip).

Direction is a relation, foreign key, location is a tuple address (via relname),
or fsource number?

- plugin *universal* [[~/gauche/gg/kahua-mmc/var/plugins/universal.scm]]

Extract info on 1 particular (the first!) tuple, and its keys!
It uses <row-tuple> from   kahua.tuples
or <virtual-row>  !!




;; -> obsoletes (use pg.result)                       ; pg:query-extract-keyed-tuples



* I want to stop using deduce.scm
